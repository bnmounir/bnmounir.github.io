## About Me

---
    Originally from the northeastern part of Algeria in a city called Batna, 
    followed a scientific track of education ever since.
    
    Moved to the U.S. (Brooklyn, New York) in 2015 in pursuit of self improvement, coding was a big part of what I was trying to accomplish in algeria, 
    I'm in a coding bootcamp graduating in 08/2019 for Web Development.
    
    Turns out the best teacher is your self when it comes to coding, which brings me to this opportunity 
    I'm very excited about working with all of the Open Learning Exchange Team and hopefully make some new friends at the same time.
