## About Me

---
    Originally from north eastern part of Algeria in a city called Batna, from an avrage algerian family, 
    followed a scientific track of education since... forever.
    
    Moved to the U.S. (Brooklyn, New York) in 2015 in pursuit of a vision of improvement, coding was a big part of what I was trying to accomplish in algeria,
    I'm in a coding bootcamp graduating in 08/2019 for Web Development.
    
    Turns out the best teacher is your self when it comes to coding, which brings me to this opportunity 
    I'm very excited about working with all of Open Learning Exchange Team and hopefully make some new friends at the same time.
